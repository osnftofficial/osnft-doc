# Uniqueness

Each NFT is represented by the project url. 

e.g - `https://github.com/ujjwalguptaofficial/jsstore`

Once you have minted a NFT for the project - you can not mint another NFT for the same project.

The project minting is also verified by Approvers (currently centralized but decentralized in future) which means any kinda of try to mint the same project won't be allowed.

> The NFT contract checks if the project is verified by approver contract and then only mint the project.
