# Overview

OSNFT stands for **opensource NFT**. It's a complete Decentralized application suite which allows to tokenize opensource projects into a NFT Collection.

## Problem

Most of the organisation from small to enterprise today uses opensource project. But almost 99 % creators are unpaid and its very hard to keep doing without any monetory help.

ðŸ‘‰ Also opensource projects needs contributors but contributors also are not rewarded because creator does not have anything to give.

<blockquote>
Every opensource project is like a small startup but it is runing without any income. It needs continuous income.

## Solution

OSNFT is trying to solve this problem by converting the opensource project into a NFT Collection without comprising on the opensource ethics.

### How this works ?

* Anyone can invest on the project by paying some amount calculated based on star and fork count of the project. The investor gets a NFT as proof of investment. 
* The amount invested is stored in the contract after royalty given to creator.
* The total amount for the project will grow with each investment from supporter.
* The value of the NFT is - total amount / no of NFT owners.

Let's understand this by an example - 

1. Alice who is working on an awesome project tokenized her repo on OSNFT. She gets the first NFT of the project which value is zero.
2. Bob found Alice repo and is using in his project to solve the problem. Bob feels this repo is great and going to be famous in future.
3. Bob decided to help Alice by supporting her through monetory amount but Bob is afraid that he won't get anything out of it. 
4. Bob see OSNFT on the repo and found that if he support through OSNFT - he will help Alice as well as gets an NFT which makes him one of the special people in the project and not that he can also earn some return when the project will become famous. 
5. Bob sees royalty of the project is 5% and price is 100$. He invests to the project by paying 100$ and gets an NFT.
6. The 5% of 100$ is given to creator and 95$ is saved into the contract. So Bob can withdraw that value anytime by burning the NFT.
7. So now Bob is associated with the Alice project and he has a NFT. 

```
The value of the NFT = total amount / no of nft owner

Since there are two NFT owners - Alice and Bob

The value of the NFT = 95/2 = 47.5 $

```

On the other hand - Alice got 5$ and her NFT value is 47.5$.

8. Bob decided to create a community for Alice projects and tell people about it - he is organizing different meetups and interacting with people to increase the awareness.
9. The project has more users, stars and fork count is increasing. The more people wants to support and there are now 5 other supports who have invested through OSNFT.

Let's say - each other 5 people paid +100 from last amount. So now NFT holder has invested following amount - 

```
Alice = 0
Bob = 100

----
Ujjwal = 200
Nishant = 300
Kalin bhaiya = 400
Guddu bhaiya = 500
Saitama = 600

Total value invested = 0 + 100 + 200 + 300 + 400 + 500 + 600 = 2100$

Total value in the contract  = 2100 - (5% of 2100) = 1995

NFT value = total value / no of nft owners = 1995 / 7 = 285
```

So now Bob NFT value is 285$ and he has gain of 185$. Amazing right ?

On the other hand Alice who is creator of the project got 285$ as NFT value and 105 as royalty value. 

ðŸ‘‰ We want to motivate existing opensource creators and encourage others to opensource.
