# Overview

OSNFT stands for opensource NFT. It's a complete DAO suite which allows to tokenize opensource projects into a NFT.

It has following components - 

1. NFT
2. Marketplace
3. Approver
4. Dapp

## Problem

Most of the organisation from small to enterprise today uses opensource project. But almost 99 % creators are unpaid and its very hard to keep doing without any monetory help.

Also opensource projects needs contributors but contributors also are not rewarded because creator does not have anything to give.

Every opensource project is like a small startup but it is runing without any income. It needs continuous income.


## Solution

OSNFT is trying to solve this problem by converting the opensource project into a NFT. The NFT can be used to earn and even reward to your contributors or your supporter.
