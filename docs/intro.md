# Overview

OSNFT stands for **open source NFT**. It's a complete Decentralized application suite which allows to tokenize open source projects into a NFT Collection.

## Problem

Most organizations from small to enterprise today use open source projects. But almost 99 % of creators are unpaid and it's very hard to keep doing without any monetary help.

ðŸ‘‰ Also open source projects need contributors but contributors also are not rewarded because the creator does not have anything to give.

<blockquote>
Every open source project is like a small startup but it is running without any income. It needs continuous income.

## Solution

OSNFT is trying to solve this problem by converting the open source project into a NFT Collection without compromising on the open source ethics.

### How this works ?

* Anyone can invest on the project by paying some amount calculated based on the star count and fork count of the project. The investor gets a NFT as proof of investment.
* The amount invested is stored in the contract after royalty given to the creator.
* The total amount for the project will grow with each investment from supporters.
* The value of the NFT is = total amount / no of NFT owners.

Let's understand this by an example - 

1. Alice, who is working on an awesome project, tokenized her repo on OSNFT. She gets the first NFT of the project whose value is zero.

2. Bob found Alice repo and is using it in his project to solve the problem. Bob feels this repo is great and going to be famous in future.

3. Bob decided to help Alice by supporting her through a monetary amount but Bob is afraid that he won't get anything out of it.

4. Bob see OSNFT on the repo and found that if he support through OSNFT - he will help Alice as well as gets an NFT which makes him one of the special people in the project and not that he can also earn some return when the project will become famous. 

5. Bob sees the royalty of the project is 5% and the price is 100$. He invests in the project by paying 100$ and gets an NFT.

6. The 5% of 100$ is given to the creator and 95$ is saved into the contract. So Bob can withdraw that value anytime by burning the NFT.

7. So now Bob is associated with the Alice project and he has a NFT. 

```
The value of the NFT = total amount / no of nft owner

Since there are two NFT owners - Alice and Bob

The value of the NFT = 95/2 = 47.5 $

```

On the other hand - Alice got 5$ and her NFT value is 47.5$.

8. Bob decided to create a community for Alice projects and tell people about it - he is organizing different meetups and interacting with people to increase the awareness.

9. The project has more users, stars and fork count is increasing. The more people want to support and there are now 5 other supporters who have invested through OSNFT.

Let's say - each of the 5 people paid +100 from the last amount. So now NFT holder has invested following amount - 

```
Alice = 0
Bob = 100

------

Ujjwal = 200
Nishant = 300
Kalin bhaiya = 400
Guddu bhaiya = 500
Saitama = 600

---------

Total value invested = 0 + 100 + 200 + 300 + 400 + 500 + 600 = 2100$

Total value in the contract  = 2100 - (5% of 2100) = 1995

NFT value = total value / no of nft owners = 1995 / 7 = 285
```

So now Bob NFT value is 285$ and he has gain of 185$. Amazing right ?

On the other hand Alice who is creator of the project got 285$ as NFT value and 105 as royalty value.
