# Use of NFT

OSNFT primarily can be used by two types of users - 

1. Opensource creator
2. Buyer - Investor/Supporter


## Creator

Opensource project creator tokenize their project into a NFT. It can be used to earn income in continuous way.

### NFT type

There are multiple types of NFT provided by OSNFT for creators which act as different levels. It is to make sure that different kinda of projects have different kinda of earning and supporters/buyers.

There are four types of NFT -

1. Direct
2. Percentage Cut
3. Equity
4. Share

#### 1. Direct

A direct NFT can be selled to one user and they own the whole NFT. It is recommended for newer projects which have just started. 

The price should be set based on the problem you are solving. For bigger problems set a good higher price but for smaller problems or POC - set good price.

#### 2. Percentage Cut

Percentage cut NFT - allows you to earn fixed percentage on each sell. This is second level of NFT and from here the creator will start earning income in continous way.

The percentage is defined by creator at the time of minting. It can not be more than 50%.

Keep the percentage cut low or average to allow interest from the investors. Generally small percentage cut means investor will have to pay lower profit of the sell means higher interest towards buying NFT.

#### 3. Equity

Equity NFT allows ownership partialiazation of a NFT. It divides the ownership into 100 which means 100 people can own the NFT. 

Think of it like a company where there are multiple owners. 

Equity is recommended for projects which is famous, have lot of users. Basically it should be in a stage where it can attract many people to own the NFT.

Equity NFT also makes possible to reward your contributors. You can transfer some of ownership out of 100 to your contributors which will keep them motivated and continued to be part on your journey.

#### 4. Share

Share NFT is similar to equity NFT except it can have many number of owners of NFT. You can define the numbers at the time of creating NFT.

Share is similar to IPO of company. You create N number of shares price at some fix price and make it available to buy in the market.

Share NFT is recommended for projects which is very very famous and it's no 1 in its field like reactjs, vuejs etc. 

The no of share should be strategically defined based on the projects. It's very important factor because based on how much share and what price - people will buy.


> As project keeps growing you can convert your NFT to higher level. You need to own the 100 % of the NFT which means once you are sure about going to higher level - buy the NFT from the owner. You can also talk to them and ask them to transfer the NFT for some return.

## Buyer - Investor/Supporter

Buyer buys the NFT acting as investor or supporter of the project. Here buyer provides funding source similar to VC'S and angel investors to these awesome projects for some return. 

ðŸ‘‰ As the project keeps growing - the value of NFT keeps increasing thus the price which means good return ðŸ˜Š for the investors.

The growth of the project can be considered from different attributes like - 

* star count
* fork count
* no of issues opened/closed
* community growth
* usage of project
* no of commits - how creators is determined
* features being added in the project

The growth is not limited to above mentioned attributes but there can be more.

### What should you do as investor ?

As an investor your primary goal is to earn which will be possible only if the project you invested grow.

We recommend following things - 

1. Before buying - Learn about the project, understand the problem it is solving and if you are convinced then invest in it. If you believe in the project then invest without further thinking. 
2. Once you have bought the NFT then make people aware about it, increase the stars and fork of the project. Ask creators how you can help them. Maintain a communication with creators on different social network. Always be supportive.
3. Once the project grows then feel free to sell it and invest in other projects using that money. Always keep investing. Think it like a stock market.
4. If you are coder then be a contributor of the project and then you can help growing the project in faster. Remember even helping with documentation is a great help.
5. Check if a project is qualified to jump to another NFT level and then talk to the creators and figure some kind of deal to take ownership in another NFT level. Remember owning partial ownership of 100 million value project is greater than owning full ownership of a 1 milliion company.
