# Use of NFT

OSNFT primarily can be used by two types of users - 

1. Open source creator
2. Buyer - Investor/Supporter


## Creator

Open Source project creators tokenize their project into a NFT collection. It can be used to earn income.

The creator will have following income sources -

1. NFT - The creator gets one NFT when they tokenize their repo. The value of the NFT keeps growing with each investment.
2. Royalty - The creator will earn royalty on each NFT mint. The royalty is defined at the time of tokenizing the project.

## Buyer - Investor/Supporter

Buyer mints the NFT by paying some amount - acting as investor or supporter of the project. Here buyers provide funding sources similar to VC'S and angel investors to these awesome projects for some return.

ðŸ‘‰ As the project keeps growing - the price of NFT increases which means good return ðŸ˜Š for the investors.

The growth of the project can be considered from different attributes like - 

* star count
* fork count
* no of issues opened/closed
* community growth
* usage of project
* no of commits - how creators are determined to work on the project.
* features being added in the project

The growth is not limited to above mentioned attributes but there can be more.

### What should you do as investor ?

As an investor your primary goal is to **earn** which will be possible only if the project you invested in grows.

ðŸ‘‰ We recommend following things - 

1. **Invest in right project** - Learn about the project, understand the problem it is solving and if you are convinced then invest in it. If you believe in the project then invest without further thinking.

2. **Increase awareness** - Once you have bought the NFT then make people aware about it, increase the stars and fork of the project. Ask creators how you can help them. Maintain communication with creators on different social networks. Always be supportive.

3. **Be an active seller and buyer** - Once the project grows then feel free to sell it and invest in other projects using that money. Always keep investing. Think of it like a stock market.

4. **Help project** -  If you are coder then be a contributor to the project and then you can help grow the project faster. Remember even helping with documentation is a great help.
