# Uniqueness

Each NFT is represented by the project url. 

e.g - `https://github.com/ujjwalguptaofficial/jsstore`

Once you have minted a NFT for the project - you can not mint another NFT for the same project.

The project minting is also verified in backend and a signature is generated to check the verification in contract level.

> The NFT contract checks if the project is verified by whitelisted special address and then only mint the project.
