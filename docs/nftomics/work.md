Unlike other arts opensource projects needs to be continuously developed which includes work like 

* Product ideation and thoughts
* Documentation
* Bug fixes
* Feature implementation
* Adding tests
* Reviewing pull request
* Creating demo and examples
* Writing article, blogs etc to tell people about the projects and features

If you will look at the amount of work being done - it actually is a small organisation in itself.
