# Work

OSNFT represents open source projects which are hard work (in the form of code or any other) done by developers/coders.

Unlike other arts **Open Source projects** needs to be continuously developed which includes work like

* Product ideation and thoughts
* Documentation
* Bug fixes
* Feature implementation
* Adding tests
* Reviewing pull request
* Creating demo and examples
* Writing article, blogs etc to tell people about the projects and features
* Solving people doubts/ answering on different forums like github discussion, gitters, stackoverflow etc

If you will look at the amount of work being done - it actually is a small organization in itself.
