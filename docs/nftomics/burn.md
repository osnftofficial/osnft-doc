# Burn 

<img src="/img/elmo-burn.gif" alt="docusaurus mascot" />

Burning means destroying the NFT.

The NFT can be burned by the nft holder which will destroy the nft and return the value of the nft to holder.

**Note:-** It is recommended to not burn the nft instead sell it to someone as price of the nft mint will be always greater than value of the nft - so its better for someone minting to buy the nft at lesser cost from any holder.
