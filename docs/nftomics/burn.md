# Burn 

<img src="/img/elmo-burn.gif" alt="docusaurus mascot" />

Burning means destroying the NFT.

The NFT can be burned by the NFT holder which will destroy the NFT and return the value of the NFT to the holder.


**Note:-** It is recommended to not burn the NFT instead sell it to someone as the price of the NFT mint will always be greater than the value of the NFT - so it's better for someone minting to buy the NFT at lesser cost from any holder.
